# Orbital Mechanics Simulation

A simple 2D orbital simulation in JavaFX that demonstrates gravitational interactions between multiple bodies.  
This version visualizes the **3-body problem**, showing the chaotic orbits of three bodies under mutual gravitational forces.  

- Bodies are color-coded for easy tracking
- Interactive visualization of classical orbital mechanics

Built with **JavaFX** in Java 19.


## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Make sure Java 19 and JavaFX SDK 19 are installed
3. Run the `Main` class to launch the simulation
