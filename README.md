OrbitalMechanics is a simple 2D physics simulation written in Java.
The project focuses on modeling orbital motion using classical
(Newtonian) mechanics and serves as a learning project combining
programming and physics.

## Features
- 2D vector mathematics (Vector2D)
- Object-oriented design
- Foundations of orbital mechanics
- Physics-oriented code structure

## Status
Work in progress
